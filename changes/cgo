  o Major features (cryptography):
    - Clients and relays can now negotiate Counter Galois Onion (CGO)
      relay cryptography, as designed by Jean Paul Degabriele, Alessandro
      Melloni, Jean-Pierre MÃ¼nch, and Martijn Stam.
      CGO provides improved resistance to several kinds
      of tagging attacks, better forward secrecy, and better
      forgery resistance. Closes ticket 41047.
      Implements proposal 359.
