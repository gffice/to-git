  o New system requirements:
    - When built with OpenSSL, Tor now requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later.
      (We strongly recommend 3.0 or later, but still build with 1.1.1,
      even though it is not supported by the OpenSSL team,
      due to its presence in Debian oldstable.)
      Part of ticket 41059.
    - When built with LibreSSL, Tor now requires LibreSSL 3.7 or later.
      Part of ticket 41059.
