  o Removed features:
    - Relays no longer support clients that require obsolete v1 and v2
      link handshakes. (The v3 link handshake has been supported since
      0.2.3.6-alpha). Part of ticket 41031.
    - Relays no longer support clients that falsely advertise TLS
      ciphers they don't really support.
      (Clients have not done this since 0.2.3.17-beta).
      Part of ticket 41031.
